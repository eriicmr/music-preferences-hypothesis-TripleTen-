# 🎵 Music Preferences Hypothesis Testing – Sprint 2 Project  

This project explores **user behavior analysis** through hypothesis testing.  
Using real streaming data, I tested whether music listening activity differs depending on the **day of the week** and the **city** (Springfield vs. Shelbyville).

## 📌 Project Overview  
The workflow followed three main stages:  

1. **Data Overview**  
   - Loaded and explored the dataset  
   - Checked column names, structure, and initial observations  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Renamed columns for consistency  
   - Handled missing values and duplicates  
   - Cleaned up string formatting  

3. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Hypothesis: *User activity differs depending on the day of the week and the city*  
   - Applied statistical methods to confirm or reject the hypothesis  
   - Documented findings and interpretations at each step
